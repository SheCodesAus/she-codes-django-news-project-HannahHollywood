3. List of Features I'm Proud of:
  Honestly everything!! But if I was to list out what I've achieved:
    - User Creation Form:
        - User can create an account
        - User can then edit their account info with a bio, avatar (which displays), social media link (which works) and location
        - This all then displays on a User Profile which is editable
        - On the User Profile they can view stories they've written and write stories directly from the profile view

    - Author View
        - A really cool feature I was proud of creating/designing where people can view all the authors on the website like the story index page

    - Index & Other
        - Enabled and Disabled many features depending on whether uses were logged in or out
            eg. 
            - 'Sign Up Today!' on home page only shows if not logged in
            - Can't create, edit or delete stories if not logged in
            - Also can't edit or delete other users stories or profiles

There's a lot I'm proud of here :)
I got a little carried away with the stylings and still have things I want to do.. but overall I'm happy with the HTML/CSS work I did as well.

Things I would like to keep working on:
    - Completing the Sort by Categories Section
    - Add a way to favourite stories

Great project! Can't wait to do the next one :)
